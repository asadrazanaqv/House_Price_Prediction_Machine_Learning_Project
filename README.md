# 🏠 House Price Prediction Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates how to build a **Machine Learning model** to predict house prices based on multiple factors such as area, number of rooms, and location.  
It covers the entire ML workflow — from **data cleaning** to **model evaluation** and **prediction visualization**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to use **Regression Algorithms** to accurately predict the price of houses.  
By training the model on existing data, it learns the relationship between different features (like area, rooms, etc.) and the target variable (price).

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Loading**  
   - Imported dataset (CSV file) containing house attributes and prices.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers.  
   - Encoded categorical variables.  
   - Scaled numerical features for better model performance.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visualize relationships between features.  
   - Found key insights from correlation and distribution plots.  
4. **Model Training**  
   - Implemented **Linear Regression** using Scikit-learn.  
   - Split data into training and testing sets.  
5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Measured performance using **R² score**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.  
6. **Prediction**  
   - Predicted house prices based on new input data.
